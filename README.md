Here you will find files related to the Circuit Basics series of laser-cut wood breadboards we are developing!  The goal of this project is to share kits that help a person learn about electronics, without needing to know how to solder or have soldering equipment.  It's a throwback to OG "Breadboards" which were made of wood, used nails as common junction points, and connected components with wire wrapped around their legs and these nails.  In our case, we're using laser-cut MDF as our breadboard, and each board has a circuit engraved on it, where components are laid our like a schematic with the schematic symbols next to them.  Working with actual electronic components helps build familiarity, and having a clear spot to place each component removes some confusion that beginners can experience when first using the grid-style plastic solderless breadboards.  These also help teach schematic reading and multimeter use.

We are open-sourcing these files in our never-ending quest to reduce gatekeeping and make electronics more accessible.  This way, anyone with access to a laser cutter can create these breadboards themselves, and makerspaces and educational institutions can both make and use them as teaching tools.  We also will sell ready-made kits at alpenglowindustries.com, and we offer discounts for volume orders.

This project was initially launched thanks to funding from a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion grant from the City of San Luis Obispo.  Thanks for believing in and supporting our mission!
